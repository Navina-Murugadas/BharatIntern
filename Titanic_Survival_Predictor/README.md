# TITANIC (SURVIVAL) CLASSIFICATION
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project that aims to predict the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic using logistic regression. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this project serves as a classic example of binary classification.

# Objective: 
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify passengers as either Survived or dead(Not-survived) based on a set of features, such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

# Machine Learning Algorithm used:
Logistic Regression

# Tools/Technologies used:
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Python language
3. Numpy library
4. Pandas - Data Manipulation
5. Matplotlib - Data Visualization
6. Seaborn - Data Visualization
7. SkLearn - Model Building
8. Microsoft Excel
9. Streamlit - Framework

# Prerequisites:
1. A prior knowledge of Python programming language along with its libraries for data science such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SkLearn is needed.
2. Installation of required libraries

# Methodology
The project uses the following steps to accomplish the classification task:
## Data Preprocessing: 
We clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as needed.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
We perform an in-depth EDA to gain insights into the data and understand the relationships between various features and survival.
## Model Selection: 
We implement a logistic regression model, a classic choice for binary classification, and evaluate its performance.
## Model Evaluation: 
We assess the model's performance using relevant metric - Accuracy.
## Deployment: 
We provide a sample implementation of the model that can be used to predict the survival of new passengers using Streamlit.
